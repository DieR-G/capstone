# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Description


The CEO of Travel Europe LLC is trying to launch and maintain a completely new website to attract potential customers. They have decided to work with Google Cloud resources, their PMs advisors have recommended the organization’s CTO to hire a team of three cloud engineers and take the ‘green field’ approach for this project leveraging the power of Google Cloud resources. 

Their development team have already uploaded a GitHub repository with the build of a teaser static website [1] as Travel Europe LLC is a global organization and is seeking to attract potential customers from the Americas, they need a solution that can scale and manage containerized applications so they can then automate the life cycle management of containers [3] When using GKE the solution to deploy this website should be set behind a load balancer with an external endpoint, so it can be accessed globally.


To run or deploy this project, you will need:

* A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
